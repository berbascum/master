Huawei Stock Kernel Source 4.9.97 Pie for Mate 10 ALP-L09



CUSTOM KERNEL IMAGES
- This repository contains custom kernel imgs for Huawei Mate 10 ALP-L09 with Android Pie.
- The source code it has downloaded from Huawei website.
- The starting versions (30 and 31) are for 2018-11 security patch level (B159 firmware).
- Images are located in "master/Berbascum-files/custom-kernel-images/" folder.
- In "master/Berbascum-files/kernel-config-files/" folder there are different kernel config files from stock and custom kernel images. Also there are some diffs with the changes that I have done to the original autogenerated Kirin970 config file.
- In the next days I will try to update the kernel images to security patch level 2019-03 for B207 firmware.
- Tested only on C432 variant.

SOURCE CODE
- The project is new. Is cooming soon.
